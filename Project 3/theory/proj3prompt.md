Prompting of Backstepping-Based Adaptive Controller for Nonholonomic Mobile Robot



## Objective

Assess the ability of a large language model to understand and implement the backstepping-based adaptive controller for a nonholonomic mobile robot, as detailed in the document ``Backstepping\_v1.pdf''  The model should develop a Python simulation to verify the controller's correctness, adhering to the kinematic and dynamic models, adaptive parameter estimation, actuator dynamics, and stability guarantees outlined in the document. The implementation should be suitable for environments like Google Colab, with comprehensive visualization and numerical validation.

## Task Description

Using the provided document (``Backstepping\_v1 (3).pdf''), develop a Python simulation that implements the backstepping-based adaptive controller for a unicycle-type nonholonomic mobile robot with unknown mass, inertia, and bounded external disturbances. The simulation should include the kinematic and dynamic controllers, adaptive parameter estimation, and actuator dynamics as derived in the document. Verify the controller's performance through numerical simulation, animated visualization, and static result plots, ensuring stability and tracking error convergence as guaranteed by the Lyapunov-based design.

## Requirements

### Simulation Environment

* **Robot Model:**
    * Implement a class (e.g., `Simulation`) modeling a unicycle-type mobile robot.
    * State vector: Pose $(x, y, \theta)$ and body-frame velocities $(v, \omega)$.
    * Physical parameters: Mass ($m$), inertia ($I$), wheel radius ($r$), wheelbase width ($W$) (e.g., $m = 5$ kg, $I = 0.1$ kg⋅m², $r = 0.05$ m, $W = 0.2$ m).
    * Kinematic model: Update pose based on the document’s equations.
    * Dynamic model: Implement velocity dynamics, including control inputs and bounded disturbances ($||d(t)|| \leq d_B$).
    * Map wheel torques $[\tau_R, \tau_L]$ to generalized forces/torques $[\tau_v, \tau_\omega]$ using a transformation matrix based on $r$ and $W$.
* **Integration:** Use Euler integration with a configurable time step ($\Delta t$, e.g., 0.01 s) for both kinematic and dynamic updates.
* **Angle Normalization:** Ensure $\theta$ remains in $[-\pi, \pi]$.
* **Disturbance Modeling:**
    * Implement continuous random disturbances bounded by $d_B$ (e.g., $d_B = 0.5$).
    * Add an optional ``kick'' disturbance: Apply a fixed disturbance magnitude for a short duration when the robot is near a specified path point.

### Control System

* **Kinematic Controller (Layer 1):**
    * Input: Current pose $(x, y, \theta)$, reference trajectory $(x_r, y_r, \theta_r)$.
    * Output: Desired velocities $(v^d, \omega^d)$.
    * Functionality:
        * Compute tracking errors in the robot’s local frame (forward $e_x$, lateral $e_y$, orientation $e_\theta$).
        * Derive virtual control inputs using the Lyapunov-based law from the document (Section 3.2).
        * Ensure numerical stability for terms like $\frac{\sin e_\theta}{e_\theta}$.
        * Apply velocity limits if specified.
* **Dynamic Controller (Layer 2):**
    * Input: Current state $(x, y, \theta, v, \omega)$, desired velocities $(v^d, \omega^d)$.
    * Output: Control torques $[\tau_v, \tau_\omega]$ or wheel torques $[\tau_R, \tau_L]$.
    * Functionality:
        * Compute velocity tracking error $\eta = [v - v^d, \omega - \omega^d]^T$.
        * Estimate unknown parameters $p = [m, I]^T$ using the adaptive law (Section 4.7).
        * Implement the regressor matrix $Y_c$ for parameter estimation (Section 3).
        * Apply the control law with a robust term to handle disturbances (Section 4.7).
        * Incorporate actuator dynamics (Section 4.6) with torque tracking error and control input $a$.
* **Adaptive Law:**
    * Update parameter estimates $\hat{p} = [\hat{m}, \hat{I}]^T$ using the specified adaptive law.
    * Use a positive definite gain matrix $\Gamma_p$ and apply bounds to $\hat{p}$.
* **Stability:** Ensure the implementation follows the Lyapunov-based stability analysis (Section 6), with $\dot{V} \leq 0$ for bounded errors and convergence under persistent excitation.

### Path Generation

* Implement a function (e.g., `generate_path`) to create a reference trajectory $(x_r, y_r, \theta_r)$ with corresponding velocities $(v_r, \omega_r)$. Support at least:
    * Circle: $x_r = R \cos(t)$, $y_r = R \sin(t)$.
    * Line: $x_r = t$, $y_r = c$.
    * Sine wave: $x_r = t$, $y_r = A \sin(\omega t)$.
* Compute $\theta_r = \text{atan2}(\dot{y}_r, \dot{x}_r)$, $v_r = \sqrt{\dot{x}_r^2 + \dot{y}_r^2}$, and $\omega_r = \dot{\theta}_r$.
* Represent the path as a NumPy array of points with a configurable resolution.

### Visualization

* **Animated Visualization (e.g., `RobotVisualizer`):**
    * Use `matplotlib.animation` for real-time animation, exportable as GIF.
    * **Main Plot:**
        * Show the reference trajectory (dashed line).
        * Plot the robot’s actual path (solid line).
        * Display the robot’s position (circle marker) and orientation (arrow).
        * Update plot limits dynamically.
        * Show current simulation time.
    * **Subplots:**
        * Tracking errors ($e_x, e_y, e_\theta$) vs. time.
        * Velocity errors ($\eta_1, \eta_2$) vs. time.
        * Parameter estimates ($\hat{m}, \hat{I}$) vs. time, with true values.
        * Control torques ($\tau_v, \tau_\omega$) vs. time.
        * Disturbances ($d_v, d_\omega$) vs. time.
    * Configurable animation speed (frame interval) and frame skipping.
* **Static Visualization (e.g., `plot_results`):**
    * Generate a multi-panel figure after simulation completion.
    * Include plots for tracking errors, velocity errors, parameter estimates, torques, and disturbances.
    * Ensure clear titles, labels, legends, and grids.

### Simulation Framework

* Implement a main script (e.g., `main.py`) that:
    * Configures simulation parameters ($\Delta t$, max steps, path type, initial pose/velocity).
    * Defines robot parameters and initial parameter estimates $\hat{p}(0)$.
    * Sets controller gains ($K_x, K_\theta, K_y, K_d, \Gamma_p, K_\tau$) and disturbance bound $d_B$.
    * Initializes the reference trajectory, simulation, controllers, and visualizer.
    * Runs the simulation loop:
        * Update the robot state using the kinematic and dynamic models.
        * Compute desired velocities using the kinematic controller.
        * Compute torques using the dynamic controller and adaptive law.
        * Apply actuator dynamics to generate the final control input.
        * Store data (pose, errors, velocities, estimates, torques, disturbances).
        * Check for path completion or termination conditions.
    * Generates and saves animated and static visualizations.
    * Reports simulation progress and timing.

### Technical Requirements

* **Libraries:** Use NumPy for numerical operations and Matplotlib for visualization.
* **Code Quality:**
    * Write clear, documented code with function/class descriptions.
    * Use type hints where appropriate.
    * Handle numerical issues (e.g., division by zero, overflow in $\tanh$).
* **Performance:**
    * Optimize for efficient NumPy usage.
    * Allow configuration of animation parameters for performance tuning.
* **Error Handling:**
    * Validate path generation and simulation inputs.
    * Handle file saving for visualization outputs.

## Expected Outputs

* A Python script executable in Google Colab.
* An animated visualization (HTML5/JS or GIF) showing the robot tracking the reference trajectory, with subplots for errors, estimates, torques, and disturbances.
* Static plots summarizing final performance metrics (errors, estimates, torques, disturbances).
* Console output reporting simulation progress, completion time, and key metrics (e.g., final tracking errors).
