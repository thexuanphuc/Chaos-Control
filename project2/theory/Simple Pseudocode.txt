START
  DEFINE simulation parameters (time step, robot properties, path type, controller gains)
  GENERATE the desired path based on type
  INITIALIZE simulation environment with robot state and dynamics
  INITIALIZE kinematic and adaptive controllers
  INITIALIZE visualizer

  LOOP for a maximum number of steps OR until controller finishes:
    GET current robot state (position, velocity) from simulation
    CALCULATE desired kinematic velocities using the kinematic controller
    CALCULATE control torques using the adaptive controller based on desired velocities and current state
    APPLY torques to the simulated robot
    UPDATE robot state (dynamics, disturbance)
    STORE simulation data (state, torques, errors, etc.)
    IF controller signals finished, BREAK loop
  END LOOP

  PROCESS collected simulation data
  CREATE animation and plots of the results using the visualizer
  DISPLAY or SAVE results
